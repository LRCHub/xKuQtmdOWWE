[00:33.21] She seems dressed in all the rings
[00:38.18] Of past fatalities
[00:40.67] So fragile, yet so devious
[00:44.99] She continues to see
[00:47.61] Climatic hands that press
[00:50.70] Her temples and my chest
[00:54.42] Enter the night that she came home
[00:58.59] (Forever!)
[01:03.59] 
[01:00.36] Ohh! She's the only one that makes me sane!
[01:21.86] 
[01:22.62] She is everything and more
[01:27.23] The solemn hypnotic
[01:29.65] My dahlia bathed in possession, huh
[01:33.80] She is someone to me
[01:36.21] I get nervous, perverse
[01:38.04] When I see her it's worse
[01:40.50] But the stress is astounding
[01:42.94] It's now or never, she's coming home
[01:47.22] (Forever!)
[01:52.22] 
[01:49.47] Ohh! She's the only one that makes me sane!
[02:10.97] 
[02:06.51] Hard to say what caught my attention!
[02:11.14] Fixed and crazy! Aphid attraction!
[02:15.52] Cut my name in my face to recognize!
[02:20.03] Such a pheromone cult! Terrorize!
[02:36.53] 
[02:24.12] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[02:28.34] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[02:32.88] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[02:37.20] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[02:56.70] 
[02:52.38] Yeah!
[02:54.88] 
[03:29.08] Ohh! I'm a slave and I am a master!
[03:36.05] No restraints and unchecked collectors!
[03:40.24] I exist through my need, self obliged!
[03:44.59] She is something in me, that I despise!
[04:04.09] 
[03:48.24] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[03:52.41] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[03:56.69] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[04:01.05] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[04:05.22] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[04:09.32] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[04:13.34] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[04:17.58] I won't let this build up inside of me!
[04:37.08] 
[04:39.35] She isn't real!
[04:43.58] I can't make her real!
[04:47.74] She isn't real!
[04:51.74] I can't make her real!
[05:02.74] 
[04:55.69] She isn't real
[04:58.19] (She isn't real)
[05:00.45] Can't make her real
[05:02.64] (Can't make her real)
[05:04.71] She isn't real
[05:06.83] (She isn't real)
[05:08.86] Can't make her real
